# RCAmle

This is a package examining change point in RCA(1) model. This package is related to the paper 'The maximally selected likelihood ratio test in random coefficient models'. It contains all the data and code (written in R) to reproduce the simulations, tables, and figures in the paper. The code used in the paper is directly saved in paperCode vignette.

This was produced in R 4.2.0 and all necessary external libraries are loaded in the libraries section. Each function has comments describing the purpose of the function, the inputs, and the outputs.

The data used in the analysis are all located in the related data folder--UK covid data and US housing index data.
